- iOS 17.0 or later (for iOS target)

### Build Instructions

1. **Open the project**:
   ```bash
   open swiftdash.xcodeproj
   ```

2. **Select target**:
   - For macOS: Select "swiftdash macOS" scheme
   - For iOS: Select "swiftdash iOS" scheme

3. **Build and run**:
   - Press `Cmd+R` or click the Run button
   - For iOS, you'll need a simulator or connected device

### Command Line Build Scripts

For quick building and testing without opening Xcode, you can use the included bash scripts:

#### macOS Version
```bash
./build_and_run_mac.sh
```
This script will:
- Build the macOS app using xcodebuild
- Copy the built `.app` to `build/Debug/swiftdash.app` for easy access
- Launch the app automatically

#### iOS Version
```bash
./build_and_run_ios.sh
```
This script will:
- Build the iOS app using xcodebuild
- Copy the built `.app` to `build/Debug-iphonesimulator/swiftdash.app`
- Install and launch the app in the iOS Simulator
- Open the Simulator app for interaction
- Provide manual orientation instructions for landscape mode

#### Prerequisites for Scripts
- Xcode command line tools must be set as active:
  ```bash
  sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
  ```
- For iOS: At least one iOS Simulator device must be available

#### Benefits of Using Scripts
- **Fast iteration**: No need to open Xcode for testing
- **Easy sharing**: Built apps are in local `build/` directory
- **Automated workflow**: One command to build and run
- **CI/CD friendly**: Can be integrated into automated build processes
